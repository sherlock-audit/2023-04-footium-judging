# The transfer of ERC20 prizes may fail without reverting, resulting in the funds becoming locked

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens do not revert when a transaction fails, resulting in users' funds being locked and inaccessible to them.

## Vulnerability Detail

The  `claimERC20Prize()` function can have unpredictable behavior or cause fund loss because some ERC20 tokens do not revert or return 0 upon transfer failure.

The `claimERC20Prize()` function does not include a check to ensure that the token transfer was successful. This means that if a transfer fails, the ERC20 tokens will still be marked as claimed from the PrizeDistributor contract, even though the user did not receive them.
For more detailed information, please refer to the following material: [https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#no-revert-on-failure](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#no-revert-on-failure).

## Impact

This causes the funds of user to be locked and made inaccessible to them.

```solidity

function claimERC20Prize(
        address _to,
        IERC20Upgradeable _token,
        uint256 _amount,

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;

	    // @audit The following line can fail without reverting | will lead to locked funds!

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider modifying the specified line to mitigate the potential vulnerability. [[FootiumPrizeDistributor/L130]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L130)
to:

```solidity
require(_token.transfer(_to, value), "Token transfer failed.");
```

Implementing this change will effectively eliminate the potential vulnerability.
