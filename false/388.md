# Contract without a payable fallback cannot claim their ETH prize, resulting in the funds being stuck

## Summary

 The **`claimETHPrize()`** function will fail if the user is a contract is missing a payable fallback. This vulnerability can result in users' funds being permanently stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user is a smart contract that does not have a payable fallback function, the **`claimETHPrize()`** function in the PrizeDistributor contract will always fail. This will result in the ETH rewards of users who have won Footium events being stuck forever.

## Impact

Results in users' funds being stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet

**[[FootiumPrizeDistributor/L144-L176]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-footium/blob/main/footium-eth-shareable/contracts/FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol#L144-L176)**

```solidity

uint256 value = _amount - totalETHClaimed[_to];

if (value > 0) {
    totalETHClaimed[_to] += value;

    (bool sent, ) = _to.call{value: value}("");
    if (!sent) {
	// @audit Will enter here every time if the user contract does not have a payable fallback
        revert FailedToSendETH(value);
    }
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One potential solution to address this issue is to implement a function that allows users to delegate their rewards, or to incorporate a check that verifies whether the new club owners who are not EOAs have a payable fallback when the ClubNFT is transferred to them.
