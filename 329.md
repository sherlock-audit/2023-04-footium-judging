# Medium Severity Finding: FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol => claimERC20Prize

## Summary

Medium Severity Finding: FootiumPrizeDistributor.sol => claimERC20Prize.

## Vulnerability Detail

When claiming an ERC20 prize via the `claimERC20Prize` function, the totalERC20Claimed mapping updates as expected.
The issue is that the following `_token.transfer` is not checked, meaning the totalERC20Claimed is updated regardless
of whether the transaction was successful. 
This subsequently updates the state value `totalERC20Claimed` incorrectly.

There is a check to ensure that `value > 0`, but if the value is 0 we still continue to emit a ClaimERC20 event.

## Impact

The vulnerabilities could impact the protocol by making leaderboards redundant and spammed by malicious users.
There would also be an overhead of useless `ClaimERC20` logs, that show `ClaimERC20` events with a value of `x ETH`,
when `x ETH` was not sent. 
Logs with `0 ETH` would also be present if the remainder of `_amount - totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] = 0`.
    
In it's current state, debugging the Event logs would present major problems, as the 'valuable' logs will be muddied
with non-valid logs. Spamming the ClaimERC20 event could also cause gas related issues and a DOS.

Incorrect updates of the state value `totalERC20Claimed` will continuously push the stated totalERC20Claimed value
further from the 'true' value, and will require a newly deployed contract or contract upgrade to be set correctly
if the recommended change is not made.

## Code Snippet

A simple check of the returned value from `_token.transfer(_to, value)` will overcome this issue.

```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(...) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        ...

        if (value > 0) {
            totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
            
            // @audit -- What if the intended transfer fails? We have changed the totalERC20Claimed
            // but the transfer has failed.
            
            _token.transfer(_to, value);
        }

        // @audit -- If we have failed we still emit the ClaimERC20 event.
        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Simple changes to ensure a 0 value will not emit a invalid ClaimERC20 event, the mapping totalERC20Claimed is not
incorrectly updated after a transaction fails, and a clearer code structure. 

```solidity
function claimERC20Prize(...) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        ...

        if (value <= 0) revert InvalidETHValue(value);
        
        totalERC20Claimed[_token][_to] += value;
        bool success = _token.transfer(_to, value);
        if (!success) revert FailedToSendETH(value);
        
        emit ClaimERC20(_token, _to, value);
    }
```
