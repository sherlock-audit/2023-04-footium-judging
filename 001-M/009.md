# Loss of funds due to Unchecked return value of .transfer().

## Summary
not checking the return value of transfer() method can lead to loss of funds/ stuck funds

## Vulnerability Detail

The transfer method() returns boolean but the transferERC20() function doesn't check it.

Now when the transfer fails due to unforeseen circumstances the contract will assume the transfer was successful.

## Impact
funds can be stuck in contract because the transferERC20() functions assumes every transfer succeeds.

## Recommendation
pls check the return boolean value and make the transferERC20() function revert on failure.
